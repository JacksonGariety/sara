# Sara.js

A JavaScript framework that unites the server and client.

## What makes Sara so great?

Well, she's...

+ a single app that runs in servers and browsers (isomorphic)
+ SEO-friendly (pre-renders your views)
+ skinny (20kb client-side)
+ a node framework at heart (`npm install sara --save`)
+ 

## Example

How about a todo list app with...

+ AngularJS views
+ Data persistence
+ RethinkDB storage
+ SEO pre-rendering
+ WebSocket synchronization

See [the sara-angular example](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/Sara/tree/master/examples/sara-angular-example).

## Testing

Lint/test your code by running...

    $ gulp

...from inside of the repo.
