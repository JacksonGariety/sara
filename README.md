# Sara

The un-opinionated, all-javascript framework.

## What is Sara for?

Efficiently building modern, isomorphic apps.

## What makes Sara so great?

Well, she's...

+ one framework that spans both client and server
+ simple (`new Resource()`, `new View()`, `new Presenter()`)
+ un-opinionated
+ skinny (10kb min, gzipped)
+ fun to be around (`npm install -g sara`)

## Example

How about an app with...

+ a "post" resource with CRUD routes
+ an "about" page
+ couchdb storage
+ socket.io synchronization
+ handlebars templating

See [the example]('/JacksonGariety/Sara/tree/master/example').

## Building

Sara is open source.

Edit `sara.js` and then test/minify by running...

    $ grunt

...from inside of the repo.
