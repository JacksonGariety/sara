# Sara

The modern, isomorphic JavaScript framework for Node.js.

## What makes Sara so great?

Well, she's...

+ eaily paired with any JavaScript view layer like Angular or React
+ skinny (20kb client-side)
+ a node module at heart, (no `curl`)

## Example

How about an app with...

+ a "post" resource with CRUD routes
+ an "about" page
+ couchdb storage
+ socket.io synchronization
+ handlebars templating

See [the example](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/Sara/tree/master/examples/sara-angular-example).

## Testing

Sara is open source.

Edit `lib/*.js` and then lint/test by running...

    $ gulp

...from inside of the repo.
