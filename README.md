# Sara

The unopinionated, all-javascript framework.

## Who is Sara for?

JavaScrit\pt developers who want to efficiently build modern, isomorphic apps, but who want to use their own opinions.

## What makes Sara so great?

Well, she's...

+ one framework that spans both client and server
+ simple (`new Resource()`, `new View()`, `new Presenter()`)
+ unopinionated (she'll let you do your thang)
+ skinny (10kb min, gzipped)
+ fun to be around (`sara new myapp`, `sara make resource post`)
